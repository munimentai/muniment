# Browser probe

Run `npm run probe` from the repository root. The command builds the frontend and prints the local probe URLs.

Open `index.html` for an empty signed-in workspace. Open `history.html` for completed and interrupted fixture runs.
Open `in-flight.html` for a thread whose newest run still streams its reply while a tool runs.
Open `access.html` for the signed-in shell with the profile popover open.
Open `signed-out.html` for the signed-out screen.
Open `markdown.html` for a completed Markdown reply.
Open `onboarding.html` for first-run setup.
Open `approved-files.html` for the approved-files review.
Open `permission.html` for a run paused on a permission decision.
Open `code-diff.html` for a run paused on proposed file changes.
Open `code-diff-unavailable.html` for a run whose proposed file changes cannot be shown.
Open `applied-diff.html` for a settled run with applied file changes.
Open `select.html` for a run paused on a choice request.
Open `input.html` for a run paused on a single-line text request.
Open `editor.html` for a run paused on a multi-line text request.

Inspect `window.__PROBE__.invokedCommands` and `window.__PROBE__.eventListeners` in the browser console. Emit an event with `window.__PROBE__.emit(event, payload)`.

Capture every fixture at the default desktop size:

```sh
for fixture in index history in-flight access markdown signed-out onboarding approved-files permission select input editor code-diff code-diff-unavailable applied-diff; do
  playwright screenshot --browser chromium --viewport-size "1100,720" --wait-for-selector "[data-probe-ready]" "http://127.0.0.1:4173/test/probe/$fixture.html" "/tmp/muniment-probe-$fixture.png"
done
```
